        <h5>Getting started</h5>
        <p>
          To start using the app create an account using an email, name, and
          password. No verification necessary. No sensitive data is used or
          stored. Once an account has been made you will be taken to the
          exercise tracker.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Using the exercise tracker</h5>
        <p>
          Here you can select a date (default today), update your weight for
          that day, and begin adding exercises or workouts. A workout is a
          pre-made list of exercises you can add in order to save time. To add
          an exercise/workout to your daily log click "Add Exercise/Workout."
          This will take you to your list of exercises/workouts (default empty).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the bottom of this list you can click "Create Exercise/Workout."
          Name the exercise/workout and enter the required information. When
          you're finished click "Finish Creating Exercise/Workout" and it will
          be added to your list of exercises.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once an exercise/workout is added to your exercise/workout list, you
          may add it to your daily log by clicking on it from the list. Once an
          exercise/workout is added to your daily log you will see them appear
          on the tracker. From there you can click your logged exercises to
          begin adding sets, reps, time, distance, etc.
